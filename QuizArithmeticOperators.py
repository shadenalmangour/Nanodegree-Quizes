# Quiz: Average Electricity Bill
# It's time to try a calculation in Python!

# My electricity bills for the last three months have been $23, $32 and $64. What is the average monthly electricity bill over the three month period? Write an expression to calculate the mean, and use print() to view the result.

# Write an expression that calculates the average of 23, 32 and 64
# Place the expression in this print statement
AVG=(23+32+64)/3
print(AVG)

#Quiz: Calculate
# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# How many tiles are needed? You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print((9*7)+(5*7))

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print((17*6)-((9*7)+(5*7)))

# Quiz: Assign and Modify Variables
# Now it's your turn to work with variables. The comments in this quiz (the lines that begin with #) have instructions for creating and modifying variables. After each comment write a line of code that implements the instruction.

# Note that this code uses scientific notation to define large numbers. 4.445e8 is equal to 4.445 * 10 ** 8 which is equal to 444500000.0.

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall *= .9

# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume += rainfall

# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the reservoir in the days following the storm
reservoir_volume *= 1.05

# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume *= 0.95

# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5 

# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)
