#Quiz: Calculate
# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# How many tiles are needed? You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print((9*7)+(5*7))

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print((17*6)-((9*7)+(5*7)))
